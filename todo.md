## Current Priority
**Next Action**: Address failing tests and polish remaining edge cases

## Recent Achievements âœ¨
- **Full Implementation Complete**: All 15 planned development steps have been implemented
- **Comprehensive Verification Pipeline**: SLSA provenance, SBOM parsing, and vulnerability scanning
- **Complete Plugin Management**: Add, install, verify, and list commands fully functional
- **Advanced Security Features**: Strict mode verification, attestation discovery, trusted builder validation
- **Production-Ready CLI**: Full end-to-end workflow from OCI registry to installed Obsidian plugins

## Notes
- Each step should include comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests should be added after major phases
- All code should follow Go best practices and conventions
- Error handling and user experience are critical at each step
- Each step should produce a working CLI with expanded functionality
